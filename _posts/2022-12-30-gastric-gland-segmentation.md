Title: "A digital pathology workflow for the segmentation and classification of gastric glands: Study of gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia cases"

This paper demonstrates an exciting new tool that might have a role in increasing efficiency and standardisation of pathology reporting of chronic gastritis.  The current pathological diagnosis relies on the expertise and interest of the reporting histopathologist, and comes with a degree of inter-observer variability.
