**The ESTIMATE Study is up and running at UCLH NHS Trust in London**. 

This multi-centre study is running over the next 2 years in collaboration with Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam.  

We are including patients at risk of gastric cancer with **atrophic gastritis** and **gastric intestinal metaplasia**.  

We aim to show that targeted biopsies, using endoscopic image enhancement, offers a more accurate and reliable approach to staging the pre-malignant stomach. 
We believe endoscopic staging is the future for gastric cancer risk prediction.
